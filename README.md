 - you have to be carefull that no page or post name can not be as like as category after slash.. eg. /garments /tshirt etc.. 
 - so url will be from www.example.com/product-category/garments to www.example.com/garments
 - and most importantly if you have filter option for sub category make sure not to break down into more than 3 levels. because google only support 3 levels for Good SEO.
